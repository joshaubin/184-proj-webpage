  <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
  <p>In this project we created a cloth simulation using a Masses and Springs representation. We used numerical integration to simulate cloth motion,
    incorporated object and self collision so the cloth would not clip through scene elements nor itself, and created several shaders to vary the appearance of the cloth.

    A high <code>ks</code>?

  </b></blockquote>

  <p>
    The start behaviors of different ks values were relatively similar however the rest positions were stiffer as the spring constant (ks) values increased as there were less
    folds in the resting state of the cloth as well as decreased time to reach a stable state, with the exception of reaching values 
  >200k where the resting state was unpredictable.

      What about for <code>density</code>?
    </small>
  </b></blockquote>

  <p>
    Increasing density  produces similar effects as descreasing the spring constant in which the final resting state of the cloth is not stiff and has a unstable resting state, which is most clear when density > 100.
    Another quality of the cloth which density affects is the amount that the cloth drapes (the arch and the amount of folds) from the pinned points.

          <figcaption>Density = 100, not very clear through picture, however compared to the default density value 
            the resting state of the cloth is not stable and jitters slightly and this unstableness increases as density increases

  <blockquote><b>

      What about for <code>damping</code>?
    </small>
  </b></blockquote>

  <p>
    As damping is suppose to represent the loss of energy due to friction, heatloss, etc., a high damping value will cause the cloth to fall slowly and reach a resting state quicker 
    than a small damping value which falls quickly and flops back and forth before reaching a stable state as a higher damping value will result in more energy being
    lost due to friction per timestep as the cloth falls and conversely for lower damping values.

  <blockquote><b>
    <small>Describe the differences in the results.</small>
  </b></blockquote>

  <p>
    Starting from the lowest spring constant value, the final resting state drapes around the sphere longer and has more wrinkles throughout the cloth.
    As ks values increase, the cloth has less wrinkles (does not take the shape of the sphere as fluidly as a low ks value) and also has a decreased length of how much it drapes. 
    This makes sense from earlier analysis of changes in the Spring constant, as the material of the cloth appears to be stiffer as it falls on the sphere when the value is high.
    Another interesting affect on increasing ks values is that the cloth eventually falls off the sphere quicker than lower ks values, almost making the cloth seem
    heavier as the spring constant increased.

  <p>
    When the density is lower, the cloth bends in larger smoother shapes, whereas a higher density results in a crumpled cloth as the parts at the bottom fold under the weight of the cloth.
    Conversely, a lower spring constant leads to a crumpled cloth because it takes more force to get large displacement from the springs. A high spring constant makes for smoother larger bends.

  <blockquote><b>
  Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
  </b></blockquote>

  <p>
    A shader program is run in parallel on the GPU, and it handles parts of the graphics pipeline to allow us to do things like real time renders. Vertex shaders directly modify the geometric properties
    of a mesh. They read all of the pre-vertex values, then output a position vector and varyings for the fragment shader. The fragment shader process fragments and information computed by the vertex shader
    and return a color for that fragment.
  </p>

  Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
  Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
  </b></blockquote>

  <p>
    The Blinn-Phone model calculates the ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting reflected by a given object and combines them to create a full realistic lighting for a render.
    Ambient light is calculated simply by multiplying an ambient light constant by the intensity of the ambient light, diffuse light is the same, but the intensity of the light is 
    subject to the inverse square law and we also multiply by the angle of the incoming light and enforce Lambert's cosine law. Finally, for specular lighting we consider view angle and take the cosine
    of the normal and a bisector between the view and light directions. We enforce Lambert's law and raise this cosine to a chosen parameter p.

  <p>
    Bump mapping works by modifying the normal vectors of our mesh to make it appear as though there are bumps or other details on the render. Displacement mapping on the other hand
    directly modifies the position of the vertices resulting in a completely new geometry (and subsequently different lighting). Bump mapping results in a more clean and uniform looking render,
    while displacement mapping makes a bumpy, "chunky" look. As we increase the coarseness of our mesh our displacement shader makes even more bumps and vertex displacements.
