<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we implemented methods that allow us to generate rays, and interpolate their coordinates between the image, camera, and world spaces of our scenes.
    We then implemented Bounding Volume Hierarchies in order to make ray intersection detection possible for meshes with massive architectures and thousands of primitives. We 
    then wrote the functions for direct light illumination so we could calculate where light hits our scene elements directly. We expanded upon this by implementing the logic for 
    global illumination using Monte Carlo sampling, where we considered light that comes from a light source and then bounces between objects in the scene in order to create a more realistic and dynamic lighting look. Finally, we implemented
    adaptive sampling which allows us to reduce noise from Monte Carlo sampling by concentrating our sampling on more complex parts of the image.

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection (20 Points)</h2>
<!-- Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.

<h3>
  Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
</h3>
<p>
    In generate_ray(), we convert the input image-plane coordnates to the sensor plane of the camera space through a linear interpolation of the bounds of the camera space to the input. 
    Then, we create a point on the camera space with the normalized x,y points and create a world-direction vector for the generated ray. Lastly, we set the max and min t intersection values as specified in the spec.
    Following along in raytrace_pixel(), we sample ns_aa random rays using the method we mentioned first, and get the estimated scene radiance along this generated ray offset by a random sample from the given gridSampler.

  We followed intersection tests as described in lecture slides for primitive intersections for spheres and triangles with their specified points and the given ray. If we determined that our ray intersected a primitive at time t,
  we only updated the information of our ray if that time was earlier than its stored "max_t", as once a ray intersects an object at time max_t it no longer accurately describes the direction of the light after that time.
    
</p>
<br>

<h3>
  Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
</h3>
<p>
    To implement the triangle intersection algorithm, we followed the Möller-Trumbore Algorithm as introduced in lecture as the 2D case that was 
    presented naturally extends to the 3D case to computationally solve for the intersection of a ray and a triangle as defined by its verticies and the given ray. Möller-Trumbore utilizes Cramers Rule in this intersection test 
     and propoerties of barycentric coordinates to describe a point in relation to a triangles vertices to define valid intersections and t values between rays and triangles.

<h3>
  Walk through your BVH construction algorithm. Explain the heuristic you chose for picking the splitting point.
</h3>
<p>
    To construct our BVH, we begin with a BVH node. For each primitive passed into the node, we expand the node's bounding box in order to include the area of all bounding boxes of each primitive.
    Once our node's bounding box is constructed, we chose to separate primitives based on their position relative to the center of the largest bounding box axis. For example, if the y-axis of the bounding box is larger than 
    the x and z axes, we put all primitive's whose centroid has a y value below the overall node bounding box's centroid y value in the left child of our node. If we ever encountered a case where all primitive's centroid values in the axis of separation
    were on one side of the axis, we simply sorted the primitives by their position on this axis and put the lower half in the left child and the upper half in the right child. If our node had fewer than max_leaf_size primitives, we created a vector of our primitives 
    in order to store them in one continuous block of memory, and then set our "start" and "end" variables of the current node to the start and end iterators of that new vector.

<p>
    Here are the results of rendering beast.dae, maxplanck.dae, and peter.dae with and without BVH acceleration. In each test, rendering without BVH requires almost 10,000
    times more intersection tests per ray and takes up to 2000 times longer to render. This is to be expected as the bounding volume hierarchy allows us to logarithmically eliminate 
    portions of the scene that we no longer need to perform ray intersection tests on. Beast.dae took 87 seconds to render without BVH and 0.04 seconds to render with BVH. Maxplanck.dae 
    took 53 seconds without BVH and 0.02 seconds with BVH. Finally, peter.dae took 39 seconds without BVH and 0.02 seconds with BVH.

<h3>
  Walk through both implementations of the direct lighting function.
</h3>
<p>
    Uniform Hemisphere Sampling: To estimate the direct lighting on a point, we use a Monte Carlo estimator as specified in the spec to to achieve this estimation on how much light arrived (and outgoing) at the intersection point through rays directions uniformly sampled from the 
    hemisphere ( which we convert to world coordinates as these smaples are in the object coordinate space). If there is intersection with this generated shadow ray, then we calculate how much light is reflected back through a weighting of the reflected emission with the current surface intersection's bsdf, cos_theta of the sampled direction, and the probablity pdf. 
</p>
<p>
    Light Sampling: The implementation for Importance Sampling builds from the above implementation  however instead samples all the lights directly so that samples will converge faster (as we are testing rays that have a higher probablity of intersecting light sources). 
    Once we check that there are no objects between the hit point and the light source, we follow from the implementation for Uniform Hemisphere Sampling to calculate the estimated pixel value.

   As number of sampels per area light increases we can clearly see that noise on soft shadows (below the head of the bunny and the edges of the cube environment) significantly decreases 
   as we use more samples from each light source. 
</p>
<br>

<h3>
  Compare the results between uniform hemisphere sampling and lighting sampling in a one-paragraph analysis.
</h3>
<p>
    As we are sampling directly from light sources in importance sampling than uniform hemisphere sampling, there is a higher probablity of intersection of the tested new ray therefore achieving faster convergance 
    with less samples. Even for the same parameters, importance sampling will render better results as rays in hemisphere lighting have a lower probablity of intersecting light sources therefore have less contribution to the convergance of the desired pixel value.

<h3>
  Walk through your implementation of the indirect lighting function.
</h3>
<p>
    To implement indirect lighting, we take a recursive approach. First, we start with our radiance being simply our zero_bounce light. We then add the at_least_one_bounce_radiance. 
    We calculate the hit point of our given ray on the given object that it's bouncing off of, and then from that hit point we sample the direction of a reflected ray. 
    We calculate if this new ray intersects another object in the scene and if it does, we recurse with a probability of 0.7. 
    We add the value of this recursion multiplied by the bsdf of the object and the cosine of the angle between the light and the z axis of the object, and then we divide this result 
    by the likelihood of that sample and our continuance probability. Our recursion ends if we fail the russian roulette coin flip, or if our ray's depth member variable is set to 1.

<p>
    When max ray depth is set to 0, we only see light that shines directly from a light source to the camera, as we do not consider light that bounces off of objects. 
    As we increase the max_ray_depth, the details of the underside of the bunny start to become clearer and more illuminated. This makes sense as when you 
    increase the max ray depth you allow more light to bounce from the ground or other objects in the scene, onto the underside of the bunny. Also as we increase
    ray depth, the shadow under the bunny becomes more accuraltely defined, and the ceiling and corners of the room are better lit.

Pick one scene and render it with at least 2048 samples per pixel. Show a good sampling rate image with clearly visible differences in sampling rate over various regions and pixels. Include both your sample rate image, which shows your how your adaptive sampling changes depending on which part of the image you are rendering, and your noise-free rendered result. Use 1 sample per light and at least 5 for max ray depth. -->

<p>
    Adapting Sampling aims to improve efficiency in the ray-tracing algorithm by optimizing the amount of rays sampled per pixel i.e. terminating the loop early in raytrace_pixel for areas of the image which do not require many samples.
    We achieve this by keeping track of variables to analyze some statistics of each pixel test whether it has converged to its desired value, (Mean, variance, and confidence intervals of a desired convergance value). The algorithm was implemented as per the spec 
    in which we added variables of s1, s2, and xk to keep track of specific sums of illuminance values of each pixel  and checks every samplesPerBatch samples whether to end tracing the ray. As we can see, the ceiling light has a blue color which indicates that it had a low sampling rate (as it does not need to be tested extensively that this area will be pure white)
