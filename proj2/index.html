<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we essentially built a 3d renderer. We implemented the logic to calculate Bezier curves and surfaces with 1D de Casteljau subdivision 
    and separable 1D de Casteljau respectively. We also implemented a way to do smooth, Phong shading using are weighted vertex normals, and we also implemented 
    methods to flip or split edges of a 3d mesh and used these two methods to perform mesh upsampling. We personally found the area weighted normal shading really interesting, 
    as it completely transforms the quality of some of our 3d renders.

</p>
<br>


<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<p>
  De Casteljau's algorithm is used to recover a point on a Bezier curve given a certain number of control points which define the Bezier curve. The algorithm achieves this by recursively performing linear interpolations between the control points at a specified scalar t 
  until one point remains, which will be a point on the Bezier curve. We impleted this algorithm by filling in the EvalueStep() function which only performs 
  one step of this recursive algorithm, more specifically, given a set of n points, the function will return n-1 interpolated points at the specified t value.
</p>

<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces as given nxm control points (the grid which defines the surface), we will do 1D De Casteljau evaluations on the n "curves" of dimension m-1 on the parameter u. This will give us n new control points which will define a "moving curve" in the u-axis, and this is 
    where the natural extension of De Casteljau algorithm comes into play as with these newly defined control points (the Bezier curves evaluted at u) we can use 1D De Casteljau again however with the given v parameter to finally evaluate a point on the Bezier surface which is defined by these nxm grid points.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    We used the half-edge data structure to iterate through all faces incident to the given vertex. For each face, we compute the area weighted normal of triangle ABC
    as (AB x AC) / (0.5 * ||(AB x AC)||). After computing the area weighted normal of each face incident to the vertex, return the weighted sum of these normals.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    To implement edge flip, we first stored all variables of the relevant mesh (vertices, half edges, faces, edges). Then, according to drawn diagrams of the mesh 
    before and after the edge flip, we reassigned the pointers of the mesh using setNeighbors. We found that in order to prevent bugs in the more intricate operations later in the project,
    it was best to do this for all half edges for some redundancy. We also found it helpful to keep a table for each half edge on paper that lists each half edge's vertex, next, twin, edge and face.

</b>
<p>
  After many unexpected face disappearances throughout the project, we found it best to just be as redundant as possible in this method. Where we first attempted to call setNeighbors as few times as possible,
  eventually it became worth it to us to double check the assignment of pretty much every relevant element in the given mesh.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Learning from task 4, we again stored all of the relevant vertices, edges, faces, and half edges of our mesh at the given location. We then drew diagrams on paper of the section before and after the edge split occurs,
    and we noted which elements were created. We created one new vertex, new edges, new half edges, and two new faces. We then went through each half edge and called setNeighbor, filling in the information we got from our diagram and tables. We 
    calculated the location of our new vertex simply as the average of the locations of the vertices on the given edge e0.

<b>
  Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p> 
    Even though we learned from our flip journey, we still managed to mis-assign some faces and cause our program to crash after doing multiple splits. We again fixed this by being as thorough as possible and carefully tracing each half edge in our diagram.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We implmeneted the loop subdivision as described in the comments of the function and the spec. 
    First we compute the new positions of vertices  using the neighboring-vertice traversal introduced
    in the primer to geat all neighboring positions and computed the positions as specified in the spec and also set all vertex values to not 0. 
    We similarly traversed through the edges. 
    Then, when splitting every old edge, we accounted for the vertices isNew variable to avoid an infinetly loop of 
    splitting edges we just previously split. 
    Additionaly, we then flip every new edge which connects an old vertex to a new one with taking to account the extra
    member variables as we updated our edgeSplit method to set these variables accordingly.
    Lastly, we used the newPositions we computed first to set the vertex positions.
</p>
<br>

<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    As seen in the screenshots below, corners and edges become rounder as you increase upsampling however the 
    faces of the cube become assymetric and the corners seem to have a slight pull. We can reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges
    so that The Upsample algorithm has more samples to calculate desired vertex positions.

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    The above screenshots show iterations of cube.dae with no modifications to the original mesh. To subdivide the cube symmetricially, we split the edges across the faces of the cubes to achieve more uniformity in the distances 
    between vertices / symmetry between the faces themselves prior to upsampling. This also adds more vertex points for our upsample algorithm to calculate the desired "new position" of vertices and this increase of samples of vertices prior to the nonmodified case 
    reduces the quadric error. The original mesh is essentially undersampled and performing these additional flips will help the algorithm converge symmetrically.
